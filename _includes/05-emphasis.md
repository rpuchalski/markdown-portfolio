I am highly interested in a data analyst, business intelligence or strategy analyst position, and I feel as though the experience I have already cultivated makes me a good candidate. I have an undergraduate degree in Computer Science and an MBA from the University of Scranton, and I have held various analytical positions in the transportation, professional services, hospitality and pharmaceutical industries. I was a **financial/budget analyst** with PENNDOT, a **systems analyst** with Booz Allen Hamilton, an **auditor** for the Radisson hotel and 3 food and beverage outlets, as well as a technical and product analyst with 2 different pharmaceutical companies.  

In addition to my experience, I have been staying informed about data and strategy analysis technologies by taking a DataCamp course on **R** and **RStudio**, familiarizing myself with other visualization software (i.e. **Tableau**), reading articles provided by _Data Science Weekly_, _O'Reilly_, and the _IBM_ newsletter and by attending a virtual IBM Conference. If you have any other recommendations about other resources that I should explore or other people that I should talk to, please let me know.
